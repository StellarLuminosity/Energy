Results to Report - last test run of prerun.py:
--- Idle Baseline Results ---
  Average Power: 35.03 W
  Min Power: 34.04 W
  Max Power: 76.81 W
  Stable: False (std 4.93W > 1.00W; max-mean 41.79W > 10.00W)
  Std Dev: 4.93 W
  Samples: 601

Directories to clear / check before runs:
- For energy logs: /home/klambert/projects/aip-craffel/klambert/Energy/logs
- For Tulu core datset: /scratch/klambert/dataset/tulu-3-sft-mixture-preprocessed

KD:
- For teacher logprobs: /scratch/klambert/dataset/logprob_cache/teacher_logprobs
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/kd_32b_to_1b

SFT:
- Synthetic dataset path: /scratch/klambert/dataset/synthetic_32b_to_1b
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/sft_32b_to_1b
- Change dataset choice in the sft and base configs before launching scirpts!

DPO:
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/dpo_32b_to_1b

!! Move the energy logs from the trillium cluster into the home directory !!

What still needs to be coded:
[X] Copy configs
[X] test the KD pipeline
[X] Launch the KD pipeline for 
    [X] 1b 
    [X] 7b
    [X] 13b
[X] SFT: add preprocessing scripts for two additional datasets; 
[X] SFT: update synthetic data generation to handle those datasets
[X] Test the synthetic generation script
[X] test the SFT main pipeline
[X] Launch the SFT pipeline for 
    [X] 1b
    [X] 7b
    [X] 13b
[] Write proper benchmarking and plotting scripts
[] benchmark KD
[] benchmark SFT
[] update and finalize the outline for ICML - email Sasha to confirm
[] compare energy metrics for KD and aggregate them for the paper
[] launch SFT runs
[] run benchmarking on SFT models
[] aggregate energy experiments for SFT models
[] test the DPO preference dataset generation script
[] run the dpo preprocessing pipeline
[] run the dpo pipeline
[] accumulate and add logs for the paper

What still need to be done:
[] unadd configs folder from the .gitignore
