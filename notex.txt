Results to Report - last test run of prerun.py:
--- Idle Baseline Results ---
  Average Power: 35.03 W
  Min Power: 34.04 W
  Max Power: 76.81 W
  Stable: False (std 4.93W > 1.00W; max-mean 41.79W > 10.00W)
  Std Dev: 4.93 W
  Samples: 601

Directories to clear / check before runs:
- For energy logs: /home/klambert/projects/aip-craffel/klambert/Energy/logs 
- For Tulu core datset: /scratch/klambert/dataset/tulu-3-sft-mixture-preprocessed

KD:
- For teacher logprobs: /scratch/klambert/dataset/logprob_cache/teacher_logprobs
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/kd_32b_to_1b

SFT:
- Synthetic dataset path: /scratch/klambert/dataset/synthetic_32b_to_1b
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/sft_32b_to_1b

DPO:
- Env metadata, checkpoints, and model: /scratch/klambert/model_log/energy_experiments/dpo_32b_to_1b

What still needs to be coded:
[] SFT: add preprocessing scripts for two additional datasets; 
[] SFT: update synthetic data generation to handle those datasets

What still needs to be coded:
[X] Copy configs
[X] test the KD pipeline
[X] Launch the KD pipeline for 
    [X] 1b 
    [X] 7b
    [X] 13b
[] Test the synthetic generation script
[] SFT: add preprocessing scripts for two additional datasets; 
[] SFT: update synthetic data generation to handle those datasets
[] test the SFT scripts and dataset contents
[] test the SFT main pipeline
[] run the dpo preprocessing pipeline
[] TEST ALL THE PIPELINES AND SET UP RUNS SO THAT THEY RUN IN PARALLEL

Things to fix:
[] training logging for the KD pipeline

What still need to be done:
[] unadd configs folder from the .gitignore
